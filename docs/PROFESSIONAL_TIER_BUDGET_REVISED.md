---

## **Adding Team Members (Read-Only Users)**

If you need more than 10 users but most only need read-only access:

### Option 4: 10 Premium + 15 Team Members
| Component | Quantity | Unit Price | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| RPA Platform | 1 | $1,167 | $1,167 | $14,004 |
| Dynamics 365 BC Premium | 10 users | $100/user | $1,000 | $12,000 |
| Dynamics 365 Team Members | 15 users | $8/user | $120 | $1,440 |
| Power BI Pro | ✗ | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$2,287** | **$27,444** |

**Total users**: 25 (10 full + 15 read-only)

**Best for**:
- 10 people who create/edit transactions (accounting, PMs)
- 15 people who only view reports (foremen, supervisors, executives)

---

## **Power BI Considerations**

### Without Power BI Pro ($0)

**What you CAN still do**:
- ✅ Use Dynamics 365 built-in reports and dashboards
- ✅ Export to Excel for custom analysis
- ✅ Use Power BI Embedded (limited free tier)
- ✅ Use Dynamics 365 Insights (built-in analytics)

**What you CANNOT do**:
- ❌ Create custom Power BI dashboards
- ❌ Share Power BI reports across organization
- ❌ Use advanced Power BI visualizations
- ❌ Scheduled report refresh

**Recommendation**: Start without Power BI Pro, add later if needed.

### If You Add Power BI Pro Later

| Option | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | When to Add |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Power BI Pro (5 users) | +$50 | +$600 | When you need custom dashboards |
| Power BI Pro (10 users) | +$100 | +$1,200 | When executive team needs reports |
| Power BI Premium (Per User) | +$200 | +$2,400 | When >10 users need dashboards |

## **Revised ROI Calculations**

### Option 1: 5 Premium Users ($1,667/month)

**Construction Company Profile**:
- 15-20 employees

- **Total savings**: $6,300/month

**Costs**:
- RPA + Dynamics 365 (5 users): $1,667/month

**Net Benefit**:
- $6,300 - $1,667 = **$4,633/month net savings**
- **Annual ROI**: 278% ($55,596 savings / $20,004 cost)
- **Payback period**: 4.3 months

### Option 2: 8 Premium Users ($1,967/month)

- **Total value**: $10,750/month

**Costs**:
- RPA + Dynamics 365 (8 users): $1,967/month

**Net Benefit**:
- $10,750 - $1,967 = **$8,783/month net savings**
- **Annual ROI**: 446% ($105,396 savings / $23,604 cost)

### Option 3: 10 Premium Users ($2,167/month)

**Construction Company Profile**:

- Reduced errors/rework: $2,000/month
- **Total value**: $21,500/month

**Costs**:
- RPA + Dynamics 365 (10 users): $2,167/month

**Net Benefit**:
- $21,500 - $2,167 = **$19,333/month net savings**

## **Budget Recommendation**

### **Recommended: Option 3 - 10 Premium Users**

**Price**: $2,167/month ($26,004/year)

**Why this is optimal**:
1. **Affordable** - $1,500/month less than current Professional tier
2. **Sufficient users** - 10 full users covers most medium construction companies
3. **No Power BI** - Start without, add later if needed (+$50-$100/mo)
4. **Strong ROI** - 890% annual ROI with 1.3 month payback
5. **Scalable** - Can add Team Members ($8/user) for read-only access

**Total first-year cost**:
- Setup: $10,100
- Monthly: $2,167 × 12 = $26,004
- **First year total**: $36,104

**Compare to**:
- Current Professional tier: $54,104 first year (saves $18,000!)
- Enterprise tier: $438,800 first year (saves $402,696!)
